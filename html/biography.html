    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        <font size="4">
        Neeraj Chopra did not have a clue that he would become a world champion when he turned to sports
         at the age of 13 to attain some confidence and lose excess weight. While watching a sports event at Panipat’s Shivaji Stadium, 
         he became fascinated with javelins. He found that he could throw to a distance of more than 40m despite being untrained. At that time, 
         prominent javelin thrower Jaiveer Choudhary realised his potential and talent and took it upon himself to mentor him. Neeraj proved to
          be a dedicated learner and flourished.
